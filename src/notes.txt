Queue Family:
- a set of one or more queues which have similar functionality (GRAPHICS, TRANSFER, COMPUTE)
- each queue family own's their own resources

Queue:
- is where commands are submitted
- note: a queue guarantees submission FIFO but the commands execute asynchronously
    E.g: a write can be submitted before a read but it may not finish before executing the read
- if queues are from the same family, resource sharing between the queues is allowed even with EXCLUSIVE mode
- if queues are from different families, manual queue family ownership transfer must be used unless CONCURRENT mode is used

vkImageSubresourceRange:
- specifies an image from properties like:
- mipmap, layer
- aspect describes which bits are actually used in the format (usually for formats including both STENCIL + DEPTH)

vkImageLayout:
- essentially the layout in memory of an image
- it may be more efficient to store an image in one layout than another

vkImageTiling:
- like an image layout (defines memory arrangment of image) but fixed and cannot be changed
- VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR is row major (like a matrix of pixels)
- use VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL if you don't need to read on CPU

vkImageMemoryBarrier:
- used to synchornize image layout transitions from old_layout -> new_layout
- src_queue_family_index/dst_queue_family_index is used to transfer ownership between queue families
- use QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED if no transfer

vkCmdPipelineBarrier:
- used to execute a memory barrier
- this syncs commands submitted to a queue via a command buffer
- a memory barrier is like a link in a queue (write -> barrier -> read)
- note: a queue guarantees submission FIFO but the commands execute asynchronously
    E.g: a write can be submitted before a read but it may not finish before executing the read
- the barrier must wait until src_stage_mask (stage in the pipeline) finishes
- dst_stage_mask is what must wait for src_stage_mask
    (it must be specified as it tells vulkan which commands must wait until src_stage or vulkan will not otherwise)

vkAttachmentDescription:
- a description of an attachment (how an image will be used in the subpass)
- store/load operations
- color/depth
- format

vkAttachmentReference:
- references an attachment + an image layout which will be automatically transitioned by vulkan in the subpass

vkSubpassDescription:
- a render pass (like a step in a feed-forward post proccessing effect)
- defines input attachments refs (for reading) and output attachments refs (for writing)
- note: this means the attachment references must have correct image layout for read/write

vk::SubpassDependency:
- used to synchornize betweeen subpasses and implicit external subpasses (before or after the full renderpass)
- src/dst subpass is the index to the subpass
- src_subpass=VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL for the external subpass
- src/dst stage in the pipeline + src/dst access flags

vkRenderPass:
- wraps all subpasses and dependencies

vkFrameBuffer:
- connects an image view to an attachment
- the p_attachments parameter specify the image views to connect to the attachments which are specified in the render pass
- the image views are connected by their index in p_attachments to the coresponding attachment index defined in render pass

vkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding:
- describes the binding of a descriptor
- binding index, type

vkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo:
- describes the layout of a set of descriptors
- contains multiple descriptor layout bindings
